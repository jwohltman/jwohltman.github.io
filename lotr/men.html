									<h3 class="major">History of Men</h3>
									<p>All men bear the Gift of Men, which is mortality. This also makes them susceptible to illness and disease.
											Although all Men of Middle-earth were related to one another, there were many different groups with different cultures.
											The most important group in the tales of the First Age were the Edain. Although the word Edain refers to all Men, the Elves use it to
											distinguish those Men who fought with them in the First Age against Morgoth in Beleriand from others. </p>

									<p>There are many various classifications of men. Edain and Dúnedain are both similar. They have a special gift from their descendant Elros.
											They get the life of two men, they live twice as long as normal men. Black Númenoreans and Haradrim are both men that fell under the
											evil spell of Sauron and Morgoth and fought for them. Easterlings are almost in a league of their own. Initially they fought for Elves,
											but they began to see Sauron's power grow so they sided with him. Then when he was defeated they alone attacked Gondor. When they were
											defeated they then worked for Gondor, until Sauron's power grew yet again and they attacked Gondor again. Because men don't live as lone
										 	as elves and other beings, there are not nearly as many men who lived such adventerous lives as Elves do. </p>
