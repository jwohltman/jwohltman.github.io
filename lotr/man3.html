										<p>At the start of the Third Age the Woodland Realm grew dark from a Necromancer. Because of this, the Woodland Realm now becane known as Mirkwood.

									<h2 class="major">The Quest of Erebor</h2>
									<p>When Thorin Oakenshield and his party of Dwarves entered northern Mirkwood, Thranduil captured Thorin and locked him up in a secure room when he refused to divulge his true intentions. The Dwarves were treated well, with plenty of food and drink. Subsequently, when the rest of the Dwarves had been captured by the elves, Thranduil had them unbound and treated them as his guests, until they angered him by being surly and impolite,
										 and not revealing why they had entered the forest. He did not tell them that Thorin was also his prisoner</p> <br />
									<p>After the death of the Dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the Bowman's claim of a share of the treasure the dwarves recovered from the Lonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale.
											Thranduil led the elven forces in the Battle of the Five Armies. His army was position on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge.
											After the battle and of Thorin's death, Thranduil took Orcrist, which was previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb. The treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the emeralds of Girion. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the elf-host back to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil asked them to.
											When Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of "elf-friend" and returned with his host in their halls.

							<p>After the fall of Mordor and Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of the Woodland Realm as the Mountains of Mirkwood.
									Upon doing this, his realm flourished in the early Fourth Age. It is unknown whether he sailed to the Undying Lands
									or stayed behind to continue to rule Mirkwood.</p>
