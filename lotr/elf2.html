										<p> Elrond, Lord of Rivendell called together a council when a Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins brought the One Ring to Rivendell.
											 	At this council were Elves, Men and Dwarves. Elrong explained that the Ring must be destroyed, and the only way to do that was to
												take it to Mount Doom and throw it in the fires where it was made. </p> <br />
										<p> As the journey was too perilous for just one to handle, Elrond concided that all join together to help each other. There was a total of
												nine members including. There were four Hobbits: Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, two men: Aragorn, and Boromir, one dwarf: Gimli, one
												wizard: Gandalf, and Legolas was the lone elf. The nine were brought together to destroy the One Ring. </p> <br />

										<h2 class="major">Battle of the Hornburg</h2>
										<p>The Battle of the Hornburg, or more commonly referred to as, The Battle of Helm's Deep was fought at Helm's Deep. Saruman sent his army of 10,000
												Uruk-hai to extenguish the people at Helm's Deep. Theoden, King of the Rohirrim, brought his 1,000 soldiers there to defend his people.
											 	An army of 500 Elves from Lórien arrived to help the Rohirrim just before the Uruk-hai were there.</p> <br />
										<p>Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn had since been seperated from the other four Fellowship members (Boromir was killed). They found themselves in the open lands
												of Rohan. They helped the people of Edoras make their way to the much more fortified Helm's Deep. Once there, they decided to stay and help protect it.
												As the battle drew on, all seemed lost, that is until Gandalf arrived with the entire Rohan army of 2,000. The Uruk-hai were forced to retreat and Helm's Deep
												was saved. </p>

									<p>The Battle of the Pelennor Fields was a battle for the city of Minas Tirith, and ultimately for Gondor, during the War of the Ring.
										It was the greatest battle of the War of the Ring, and indeed the largest of the entire Third Age.
										Major casualties resulted from this battle - including the deaths of King Théoden and the Witch-king of Angmar. </p>
									<p> During the initial skirmishes, Legolas, accompanied by Aragorn and Gimli, went to the Path of The Dead. In there, was an undead army waiting
											to be set free. Only the heir to Gondor's throne could do so, which Aragorn was. He told the dead if they fought for him, he would grant them
											their freedom. Upon arrival, Minas Tirith had already been breached, but not outrighted defeated. The undead, along with Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn
											were able to save the city and drive the reaming Sauron forces back to Mordor.

							<p>After the One Ring was destroyed Legolas went to Minas Tirith to witness the corronation of Aragorn. After this,
									he returned home to Mirkwood to help rebuild the war-ravenged lands. He and Gimli then traveled to Helm's Deep to view
									Glittering Caves like they promised they would. After this, Legolas sailed to the Undying Lands. He was able to take
									Gimli with him, making him the only Dwarf ever to make the trip. </p>
